        It's about the pixel-perfect designs I learned to make. I started my

        Figma and convert them into code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I applied my knowledge when I also learned about SAP UI5. I made a few

        I started my journey with backend development by learning PHP & MySQL. I

        Isn't Kubernetes just amazing? I am not a cloud guy, but I know how to
        make a cluster, deploy an application, and make it available to the

        I also learned about Piper with Azure DevOps & made sure that the bridge

      <p>
        Whether it's about the code I write or the designs I make, I like to be
        a perfectionist. I tend to be very particular about the quality of the
        work I deliver. I like to make sure that the code I write is clean,
        readable, and maintainable. I like to make sure that the designs I make
        follow the basic principles of design.

      <p>
        The problem I face is whenever I start a project, I never complete it. I
        bounce between too many ideas. I am trying to overcome this by making
        sure that I complete the projects I start.

        Well, we know that then golden ratio(Ï†) is <u><i>1.618033988</i></u
        >. So I took a width of <u>200</u>. I then calculated the height by
        dividing the width by Ï†. The height came out to be <u>323.6</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now to find how many squares I needed in width, I did
        <u>round(sqrt(w / Ï†))</u> and for height I did
        <u>round(sqrt(w * Ï†))</u>. So Now I have a grid of
        <i>11 x 18 squares</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, I also wanted to determine each square's size. So I divided
        <u>w by the number of squares in width</u>, which comes around
        <i>18.12</i>, and now I have everything I needed.

        Most of the projects I've developed have been focused on automation.
        Yes, by automation I mean actual automations, but it's not just limited
        to that. I think for me automation is really different. It's not just
        about making things easier but also about making things better. Whether
        it's automating repeated tasks I do in the morning when I open my
        laptop, whether it's the bootstrapping for projects I do in my company
        when working on PoC, or whether it's about automating the process of
        deploying the application to the cloud, I think automation is the key to
        success.

          because I was never able to care about my own mental health before.
          This is where I got involved in one of my company's initiatives: a
          one-stop platform where employees can feel valued, cared for, and free
          to talk about their mental health. The main goal of this project was
          to impact the mental health of employees in a positive way. And seeing
          the usage of the platform, I can say that we have been successful in
          doing so.

          This was one of the projects I did as part of my dissertation. I had
          been working on various PoCs for about a year, managing everything
          from development to production by myself. This included development,
          deployment, and SAP standards. These experiences inspired me to create
          a VSCode extension where developers can select their preferred
          frontend and backend technologies. Additionally, they can opt-in for
          SA-specific authentication, deployment, and other features. Along with
          the VSCode extension, I also created CLI and UI versions of the same
          tool. It has around 1.5K+ downloads

        I have always tried to learn new things. AI was one of them. For me, the
        main struggle was coding it. It's not that I was unable to code. But
        what frustrated me was how simple it was. The theoretical part was so
        complex, yet whenever I programmed it, the solution came out in just
        5-10 lines. I think my ego was too big to handle that. So, I never
        actually got into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that changed when I got into one of the foundation courses at my
        company. A month into the course, I learned about different concepts.
        This inspired me to create a project where I could implement what I had
        learned. That's when I created Book LLM. It's actually pretty simple,
        and similar tools already exist. However, the main goal was to learn and
        implement the concepts I had studied. Users can simply upload any kind
        of document and query through it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I added some extra features to make it stand out. The app has two parts:
        one for beginners who just want quick answers through a simple UI, and
        another for developers. The developer interface provides API access
        where they can fine-tune the model, prepare a pipeline for document
        splitting, and customize the entire RAG model. It was pretty sick to be
        honest.

        It's a simple project inspired by
        <a href="https://debarghyadas.com/" target="_blank" class="new-anchor"
          >Deedy</a
        >. For those unfamiliar, Deedy is a well-known developer who created a

          target="_blank"
          class="new-anchor"
          >LaTeX template for resumes</a
        >. It was created
        <script>
          const deedyYears = new Date().getFullYear() - 2015;
          document.write(deedyYears);
        </script>
        years back. My project takes that concept further - think of it as
        Deedy's template on steroids. Users can store their resume data in a
        structured JSON file, then either upload it to a GitHub issue or create
        a PR. A bot automatically detects the submission and generates beautiful
        resumes. The output is highly configurable - you can choose between
        two-column or single-column layouts, different fonts, and other styling
        options. I implemented the golden ratio in the design because I'm
        passionate about mathematical aesthetics.

      <p>
        I discovered my love for exploring new things during COVID. I started
        cooking - mainly momos, since I couldn't find them anywhere. I learned
        guitar, and the first and last song I learned was

        I picked up skateboarding, which humorously resulted in three stitches
        on my chin. I love art and create portraits as well. I have a soft spot
        for tattoos and currently have six of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from that, I never enjoyed reading books. But I was very
        fascinated by
        <a

          >Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</a
        >
        and his interviews. So I started reading his biography. I'll update once
        I finish it.
