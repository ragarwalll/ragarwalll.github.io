        React and Next.js. I also learned how to make pixel-perfect designs in
        Figma and convert them into code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I applied my knowledge when I also learned about SAP UI5. I made a few

        Whether it's about the code I write or the designs I make, I like to be
        a perfectionist. I tend to be very particular about the quality of the
        work I deliver. I like to make sure that the code I write is clean,
        readable, and maintainable. I like to make sure that the designs I make
        follow the basic principles of design.

        The problem I face is whenever I start a project, I never complete it. I

        Well, we know that then golden ratio(œÜ) is <u><i>1.618033988</i></u
        >. So I took a width of <u>200</u>. I then calculated the height by
        dividing the width by √è‚Ä†. The height came out to be <u>323.6</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now to find how many squares I needed in width, I did
        <u>round(sqrt(w / œÜ))</u> and for height I did
        <u>round(sqrt(w * œÜ))</u>. So Now I have a grid of
        <i>11 x 18 squares</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, I also wanted to determine each square's size. So I divided
        <u>w by the number of squares in width</u>, which comes around
        <i>18.12</i>, and now I have everything I needed.

        Most of the projects I've developed have been focused on automation.
        Yes, by automation I mean actual automations, but it's not just limited
        to that. I think for me automation is really different. It's not just
        about making things easier but also about making things better. Whether
        it's automating repeated tasks I do in the morning when I open my
        laptop, whether it's the bootstrapping for projects I do in my company
        when working on PoC, or whether it's about automating the process of
        deploying the application to the cloud, I think automation is the key to
        success.

            I value mental health more than anything. One of the main reasons is
            because I was never able to care about my own mental health before.
            This is where I got involved in one of my company's initiatives: a
            one-stop platform where employees can feel valued, cared for, and
            free to talk about their mental health. The main goal of this
            project was to impact the mental health of employees in a positive
            way. And seeing the usage of the platform, I can say that we have
            been successful in doing so.

            This was one of the projects I did as part of my dissertation. I had
            been working on various PoCs for about a year, managing everything
            from development to production by myself. This included development,
            deployment, and SAP standards. These experiences inspired me to
            create a VSCode extension where developers can select their
            preferred frontend and backend technologies. Additionally, they can
            opt-in for SA-specific authentication, deployment, and other
            features. Along with the VSCode extension, I also created CLI and UI
            versions of the same tool. It has around 1.5K+ downloads

        I have always tried to learn new things. AI was one of them. For me, the
        main struggle was coding it. It's not that I was unable to code. But
        what frustrated me was how simple it was. The theoretical part was so
        complex, yet whenever I programmed it, the solution came out in just
        5-10 lines. I think my ego was too big to handle that. So, I never
        actually got into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that changed when I got into one of the foundation courses at my
        company. A month into the course, I learned about different concepts.
        This inspired me to create a project where I could implement what I had
        learned. That's when I created Book LLM. It's actually pretty simple,
        and similar tools already exist. However, the main goal was to learn and
        implement the concepts I had studied. Users can simply upload any kind
        of document and query through it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I added some extra features to make it stand out. The app has two parts:
        one for beginners who just want quick answers through a simple UI, and
        another for developers. The developer interface provides API access
        where they can fine-tune the model, prepare a pipeline for document
        splitting, and customize the entire RAG model. It was pretty sick to be
        honest.

            Deedy's template on steroids. Users can store their resume data in a
            structured JSON file, then either upload it to a GitHub issue or
            create a PR. A bot automatically detects the submission and
            generates beautiful resumes. The output is highly configurable - you
            can choose between two-column or single-column layouts, different
            fonts, and other styling options. I implemented the golden ratio in
            the design because I'm passionate about mathematical aesthetics.

            There have been numbers of times when I had to be away from my
            laptop but I didn't want to go offline. I wanted to be online while
            being away. So I created this simple tool that does exactly that. It
            moves the mouse around the screen and makes it look like you are
            online. It doesn't actually do anything, but it makes it look like
            you are online. It also supports choosing apps you want to be online
            on. So you can choose to be online on WhatsApp, Slack, Teams, etc.
            It's pretty cool, you should try it out. <br />
            P.S. only works on MacOS.

        I've been slinging code for years, churning out little web apps like
        they're going out of style. Each one's got its cute little README or a
        half-baked mini-site for docs, but here's the kicker: I kept
        copy-pasting the same tired CSS and JavaScript like some kind of digital
        packrat. Consistency? Sure, but at what cost√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùmy sanity? I could've
        gone full nerd and fired up React or Vue, but let's be real, that's like
        using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. So, I said screw it and built
        Minimalify, a no-nonsense tool that sticks to the browser's raw
        JavaScript power and doesn't make me jump through framework hoops just
        to render some beautifully made website.

        Enter <i>Minimalify</i>, my snarky little CLI sidekick with exactly two
        tricks up its sleeve: <i>dev</i> and <i>build</i>. Run
        <i>npm run dev</i>, and boom√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùyou've got a local server with instant
        rebuilds and hot-reload that's creepily obsessed with your .html, .css,
        and .js files. It slaps on your shared styles, inlines templates, and
        updates everything without that annoying full-page refresh. Ready to
        flex your project to the world? <i>npm run build</i> spits out a lean,
        minified output folder you can yeet straight to GitHub Pages. No bloated
        dependencies, no config nightmares√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùjust a stupid-fast, stripped-down
        tool that makes documenting all my apps look slick and consistent
        without breaking a sweat.

        I discovered my love for exploring new things during COVID. I started
        cooking - mainly momos, since I couldn't find them anywhere. I learned
        guitar, and the first and last song I learned was

        I picked up skateboarding, which humorously resulted in three stitches
        on my chin. I love art and create portraits as well. I have a soft spot
        for tattoos and currently have six of them.
      </p>

        Apart from that, I never enjoyed reading books. But I was very
        fascinated by

        and his interviews. So I started reading his biography. I'll update once
        I finish it.
